This project provides examples of how to build java code with apache ant.

files:

build.xml  (ant "makefile")
hello.java (java source)
hello.mf   (java manifest file needed for building the jar)
README	   (this file)

examples:

ant 	    (not parameter defaults to "all")
ant compile (compiles the java source)
ant jar     (builds a java archive)
ant clean   (cleans the directory)
ant all     (compile and jar)

N.B. This directory assumes you have apache ant installed. If it is not, then consult your distro's packaging system or visit http://ant.apache.org/ to install it yourself.
