The make file in this directory builds the java code and places it in an archive using just the current directory (and no sub-dirs).

files:

hello.java  (java source)
hello.mf    (java manifest used to build the java archive)
makefile    (makefile)
README      (this file)

usage:

make          (defaults to all)
make all      (makes compil, jar, and run)
make compile  (compiles the code)
make jar      (builds the java archive)
make run      (runs the code)
make clean    (cleans up the directory)
